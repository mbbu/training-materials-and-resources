**Add:**
- A stronger focus on Pipelines, Workflows and Containers
- Follow up Book a day for Lab tour or even wet lab practicals 
- Shadow someone in the lab
- A focus on research results interpretation (how when the focus is on pipelines?)
- Soft Skills:
    - Cover letter (motivation) and CV writing: make a mock application to EANBiT
    - Presentation skills
    - Mock interview 
    
From _**week 6**_ onwards, the interns will be assigned to a range of mini projects which the will work on to build 
on different skills acquired from _**week 1**_ to _**week 5**_.

## Notes
1. The interns will be expected to attend other adhoc trainings organized by MBBU or other organization which are deemed important for their growth.
2. The interns will self organize every day stand up meeting and make a presentation of a new concept learned within the Bioinformatics space.
3. The interns will be expected to participate in journal club  and Monday morning meetings.
4. There shall be a code/progress review every Friday of the week.
5. The interns will be expected to write a mid-internship and end of intership reports documenting their journey.
